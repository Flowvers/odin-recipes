Helloo, this is the 2nd day I have documented myself working on TOP, and its mostly going well
I hope to become a full stack developer someday, and progress is going well, and thus the honeymoon phase.
Lets see where we end up then :3

I am currently making a recipe book, and will demostrate the ability to use git, html, and css as well as the command line
Lets get started!
